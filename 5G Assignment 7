Task 2:-Discuss its interaction with upper and lower layers.
Ans:-RLC (Radio Link Control) protocol in 5G interacts with upper and lower layers as follows:-
*Interaction with Upper Layers:- In Upper layer RLC interact with PDCP(Packet Data Convergence Protocol) Layer. RLC interacts with PDCP for data transfer and flow control.

*RLC (Radio Link Control) interacts with upper layers to transfer data through three modes:

	i. Transparent Mode (TM) Data Transfer:
    - RLC receives upper-layer PDUs (Protocol Data Units) without any modification.
    - No error correction or segmentation is performed.
    - Data is transmitted as is, without any guarantee of successful delivery.

	ii. Unacknowledged Mode (UM) Data Transfer:
    - RLC receives upper-layer PDUs and performs segmentation if necessary.
    - Error detection is performed using checksums or CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check).
    - No retransmission is performed in case of errors.
    - Successful delivery of upper-layer PDUs is not guaranteed.

	iii. Acknowledged Mode (AM) Data 
Transfer:
    - RLC receives upper-layer PDUs and performs segmentation if necessary.
    - Error detection and correction are performed using checksums or CRC.
    - Retransmission is performed in case of errors.
    - Successful delivery of upper-layer PDUs is guaranteed through:
        - Acknowledgments (ACKs): Sent by the receiver to confirm successful receipt.
        - Negative Acknowledgments (NACKs): Sent by the receiver to indicate errors.
        - Status reports: Sent by the receiver to indicate successful delivery.

*In AM mode, RLC provides an indication of successful delivery of upper-layer PDUs through:

- ACKs: Sent by the receiver to confirm successful receipt of PDUs.
- NACKs: Sent by the receiver to indicate errors in PDUs.
- Status reports: Sent by the receiver to indicate successful delivery of PDUs.

This ensures that the upper layers are informed about the success or failure of data transfer, allowing them to take appropriate actions.

*Interaction with Lower Layers
RLC (Radio Link Control) interacts with lower layers as follows:

1. Interaction with MAC (Medium Access Control)

	i.  Data Transfer
        - From MAC to PHY: RLC sends PDUs (Protocol Data Units) to MAC, which then transmits them to PHY for transmission over the air interface.
       - From PHY to MAC: PHY receives data from the air interface and sends it to MAC, which then delivers it to RLC.

	ii. Feedback
	- ACK/NACK: MAC sends ACK (Acknowledgment) or NACK (Negative Acknowledgment) to RLC, indicating successful or failed data transfer.
         - Error Indication: MAC informs RLC about errors detected during data   transfer.

2. Interaction with PHY (Physical Layer)

- Data Transfer: RLC receives data from PHY, which has been received from the air interface.
- Control Signaling: RLC exchanges control signals with PHY to manage data transfer, such as:
    - Power control
    - Modulation and coding schemes
    - Resource allocation
- Link Quality Indication: PHY informs RLC about link quality, enabling:
    - Handovers
    - Link adaptation
    - Error handling

*By interacting with MAC and PHY, RLC ensures:

- Efficient data transfer
- Reliable data transmission
- Adaptation to changing link conditions
- Optimal resource utilization

*This interaction enables RLC to play a crucial role in managing data transfer and ensuring reliable communication in wireless networks.
