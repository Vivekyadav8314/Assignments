Inheritance:-
Inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of objects of another class in the hierarchy. 

When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance.

In inheritance two Class are:
1. Base Class- It is also called a Parent class and Super class.
2. Derived Class-This is derived from Base class.

Types Of Inheritance
1.Single inheritance
2.Multiple inheritance
3.Hierarchical inheritance
4.Multilevel inheritance
5.Hybrid inheritance

1.Single inheritance:-When one class inherits another class, it is known as single inheritance.

[A] ------> [B]  // 'A' is the base class/Parent/Super class, and 'B' is the Child/sub/ derived class.

Example
[Vehicle]------>[Car] //Here, 'Vehicle' is the base class/Parent/Super class, and 'Car' is the Child/sub/ derived class.

2.Multilevel Inheritance:-IN this one class inherits another class which is further inherited by another class.

[A]---->[B]----->[C]//Here, class B inherits from class A, and class C inherits from class

 'A' is the Base Class, 'B' is a Derived Class of 'A' and 'C' is Derived Class of 'B'
We can also say that A is a Super Class , 'B' is a sub class/ Intermediate base class and 'C' is a Derived Class.

Example:-
[Vehicle]---->[Car]---->[Tata Curve] //
 'Vehicle' is the Base Class, 'Car' is a Derived Class of 'Vehicle' and 'Tata Curve' is Derived Class of 'Car'

3.Multiple inheritance:-Multiple inheritance is the process of deriving a new class that inherits the attributes from two or more classes.

[A]     [B]  …..[N]
 |       |       |
 \       |       /
  \      |      /
   \     |     /
    \    |    /
     \   |   /
      \  |  /
       \ | /
[C (Derived Class)]

Here 'A', 'B',...'N' is the Base Class and 'C' is the Derived Class. 'C' is derived from 'A', 'B' ….'N'.

Example:-
[Area]     [Perimeter]
 |            |
 \           /
  \         /
   \       /
    \     /
     \   /
  [Rectangle]
 'Area' and 'Perimeter' is a Base class and Rectangle is Derived Class.


4.Hierarchical inheritance:-Hierarchical inheritance is defined as the process of deriving more than one class from a base class.

It just opposite to the Multiple Inheritance.

                [A]
               / | \
              /  |  \
             /   |   \
            /    |    \
           /     |     \
         [B]    [C]   [D]

Here, 'A' is the Base Class and 'B', 'C' and 'D' is Derived class which is derived from Base Class 'A'.

Example:-
               [Shape]
               /  |  \
              /   |   \
             /    |    \
            /     |     \
           /      |      \
          /       |       \  
         /        |        \
        /         |         \
       /          |          \
[Rectangle]   [Triangle]    [Circle] 
Here, 'Shape' is the Base Class and 'Rectangle', 'Triangle' and 'Circle' is Derived class which is derived from Base Class 'Shape'.



5.Hybrid inheritance:-Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance (Hierarchical inheritance, Multiple inheritance).

                [A]
               /   \
              /     \
             /       \
            /         \  
           [B]        [C]
           \           /
            \         /
             \       /
              \     /
               \   /
               [ D ]
       
Here, 'A' is a Base Class, 'B' and 'C' is derived Class which is derived from 'A' Base Class. And For 'D' is also a Derived class, 'B' and 'C' is Base Class for 'D'.

Example:-

               [Human Body]
                   /  \
                  /    \
                 /      \
                /        \
            [Male]    [Female]
                \        /
                 \      /
                  \    /
                   \  /
                 [Child]


Here Human  Body is a Base Class for Male and Female and Male Female is Derived Class for, And Male and Female is also a Base class for Child class is Derived from Male and Female.
