	Ø PBCH stand for Physical Broadcast Channel.
	Ø The PBCH is an important part of cellular networks, especially in 5G systems. It is the main channel through which a base station (gNodeB in 5G) sends MIB to UEs.
	Ø The PBCH carries crucial information that a UE needs to decode other broadcast information and to establish a connection with the network.
	Ø PBCH is to transport the MIB with data arriving at the coding unit as one transport blocks every 80ms.
	Ø In addition to the MIB Payload(24bits), Layer 1 information is also included.
	Ø PBCH carries MIB(Master Information Block) and MIB contains essential system information such as
	     -Cell identity
	     -System Bandwidth
	     -Frame structure
	     Scheduling information
	And more things as shown in below image
	
	
*Purpose:-
	Ø PBCH carries critical information that helps devices connect to the network and receive services. It's a one-way communication channel from the base station (gNB) to the devices (UEs).
	
*PBCH Transport Process:-



1.PBCH Payload Generation: The broadcast channel (BCH) data is generated. This is the first step where the data that needs to be broadcasted is prepared.
 
	Ø Input: BCH data, denoted as a‾0,a‾1,a‾2,a‾3,…,a‾A−1\overline{a}_0, \overline{a}_1, \overline{a}_2, \overline{a}_3, \ldots, \overline{a}_{A-1}a0​,a1​,a2​,a3​,…,aA−1​, with a payload size AAA.
	Ø Output: PBCH payload.
	Ø Description: This step generates the PBCH payload data from the BCH data. The payload size is typically 32 bits.

2.Scrambling: The generated payload is scrambled. This step is crucial for mitigating interference and maintaining the integrity of the signal.

	Ø Input: PBCH payload.
	Ø Output: Scrambled bits with CRC.
	Ø Description: The scrambling process uses the cell ID and the system frame number (SFN) to generate a scrambling sequence. This sequence is applied to the PBCH payload to randomize the bit pattern, which helps to minimize interference. The formula for MMMis given by M=SFN2mod4M = \frac{\text{SFN}}{2} \mod 4M=2SFN​mod4

3.CRC Attachment: A Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is attached to the scrambled data for error detection purposes.
	Ø Input: Scrambled bits.
	Ø Output: Scrambled bits with CRC attached.
	Ø Description: CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) bits are appended to the scrambled bits to enable error detection at the receiver.
	

4.Channel Coding: The data with the CRC is encoded to protect against potential errors during transmission.

	Ø Input: Scrambled bits with CRC.
	Ø Output: Coded bits.
	Ø Description: Channel coding (specifically Polar Coding for 5G NR) is applied to the scrambled bits with CRC to add redundancy, which helps in error correction. The output is a longer sequence of coded bits.
	

5.Rate Matching: The encoded data is then processed through rate matching to ensure that it fits the available transmission resources.
	Ø Input: Scrambled bits.
	Ø Output: Rate-matched bits.
	Ø Description: Rate matching adapts the length of the coded bits to match the available resources. This step involves puncturing or repetition of bits to fit the target code rate and resource allocation.
	

6.Scrambling: The rate-matched data undergoes a second scrambling process. This could be for additional security or interference mitigation.

	Ø Input: Rate-matched bits.
	Ø Output: Scrambled bits.
	Ø Description: The rate-matched bits undergo another scrambling stage to ensure that the modulation symbols are further randomized.
	
7.Modulation: The scrambled data is then modulated, which means it is converted into a waveform suitable for transmission over the radio frequency spectrum.
	Ø Input: Scrambled bits.
	Ø Output: Modulated symbols.
	Ø Description: The scrambled bits are mapped to modulation symbols. In the image, it shows using QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) where groups of bits are mapped to complex symbols.
	

8.Resource Element Mapping: Finally, the modulated data is mapped onto the resource elements in the frequency-time grid for actual transmission.
	Ø Input: Modulated symbols.
	Ø Output: Mapped symbols.
	Ø Description: The modulated symbols are mapped to resource elements within the time-frequency grid. This mapping determines how the symbols are placed into OFDM subcarriers and symbols.
