*PDSCH process
Each component in the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) process:

1. Transport Block (TB): The Transport Block is the main data unit prepared for transmission, containing the information to be sent over the network.

	• Note: Release 15 (Rel 15) supports up to 2 Transport Blocks (TBS)
	
2. TB CRC (Transport Block Cyclic Redundancy Check): Adds error detection capability to the Transport Block, ensuring data integrity by detecting errors during transmission.
Or 
CRC is attached to the transport Block to detect errors.
	•     For TBS > 3824, a 24-bit CRC is used.
	• For TBS ≤ 3824, a 16-bit CRC is used.



3. LDPC Base Graph: Determines how the data will be encoded for error correction, selecting the base graph based on the maximum Code Block size (Kcb).

	• Max Code Block size (Kcb) based LDPC base graph selection:
		• Type 1: 8448
		• Type 2: 3840
	

4. Code Block (CB): Divides the Transport Block into smaller Code Blocks, each processed and protected with its own CRC.
	• Each CB gets a 24-bit CRC attached

5. LDPC Coding: Applies LDPC coding to each Code Block, providing robust error correction capabilities.
	•  LDPC-based channel coding is used
	   

6. Rate Matching: Adjusts the code bits to fit the available resource.
	• Code bits are mapped to resource blocks.

7. Code Block Concatenation: The Code Blocks are concatenated back into a single stream after rate matching.

8. Scrambling: Mixing the Data.
	• Scrambled using a 31-length Gold sequence.

9. Modulation: Modulates the scrambled data to prepare it for transmission over the air.
	• Modulation table selection includes 64 QAM and 256 QAM.

10. Layer Mapping: Maps modulated symbols onto different layers based on the MIMO configuration.
	• Modulation symbols are mapped to different layers depending on the MIMO configuration.

11. Antenna Port: Assigns mapped layers to specific antenna ports for transmission.

12. VRB Mapping (Virtual Resource Block Mapping): Maps data from Virtual Resource Blocks (VRBs) to Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs).
	• VRBs can be mapped to PRBs either interleaved or non-interleaved.

13. VRB to PRB Mapping: The final mapping of Virtual Resource Blocks to Physical Resource Blocks.


These steps ensure data is encoded, error-protected, and prepared for transmission, optimizing efficiency and reliability in a 5G network.
