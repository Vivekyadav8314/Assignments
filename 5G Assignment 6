Q1.What is the role of PDCP in the LTE and 5G networks?
Ans. Role of PDCP in the LTE and 5G network are:-
	i.  Header Compression:- PDCP is responsible for compressing header of packet to reduces the size of IP headers to minimize overhead and improve efficiency and also enhance performance. 
	
	ii. Ciphering:- PDCP handles encryption and decryption of data to secures before transmission. It encrypts the data before sending and decrypts the data before receiving with higher layer for us.
	
	iii.  Data Integrity:- PDCP provide mechanisms to ensure data is not tampered with or corrupted by including checksums during transmission.
