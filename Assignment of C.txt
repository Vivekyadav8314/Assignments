Q1. Write a note on history of C Programming.
Ans. Before C Programming, we had B programming.
     C programming language developed at AT & T's Bell Laboratories of USA. 
     It Was designed and written by a man named DENNIS RITCHIE.
     C was developed in 1969, And Released in 1972.
     C Programming was developed to write the code for utility software.

       5.System Software.
 

Q1. Explain basic structure of a c program with an example.
Ans. Basic structure of a C Program are follow:-
A. Comment line- 
  This is a note where we explain about the program and also explain what certain part of your program is do/ indicate the purpose of the program.
Comments are two types:-
a. Single line comments- In this we write a single to comment. It is denoted by the '//'.
b. Multiline comments- IN this we write multiple line in comment. It is denoted by the        '/* .........*/'.

B. Pre-processor Directive:-#include<stdio.h> tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library. It is also used in symbolic constant such as #define PI 3.14(value).
The stdio.h standard input output header file contains definition & declaration of system defined function such as printf(), scanf(), etc..  .

C. Main Function:-
It is the user define function and every C program must have a 'main()' function. This function is where the program starts executing. It's mandatory in C programs.

Syntax: 
   main()
      {
         .......
         .......
      }
 The main() function return value when it declared by datatype as int main().
 From main function actually program is started and it is encloses within the pair of curly braces. 

D. Statements:-
   Inside 'main()' we write statements that perform tasks. 
   Statements are instruction that tell the computer what to do.

Example:-

#inlude<stdio.h> //Include the standard input- output library
#define PI 3.14

//The main function where execution begins
int main()
{

   // Print a statements to the cnsole
    printf("Welcome Wipro:\n");
     
    return 0;

}






        
Q2. What are the different types data types in c programming?
Ans. Data types specify how we enter data into our programs and what type of data we enter. C language has some predefined set of data types to handle various kinds of data that we can use in our program. Data type determines the type of data a variable will hold.

C language supports 2 different type of data types:
a. Primary data types:
These are fundamental data types in C namely integer(int), floating point(float),
character(char) and void.
 int size = 2 bytes
 long int = 4 bytes
 float = 4 bytes
 double = 8 bytes
 long double = 10
 char = 1 byte

b. Derived data types:
Derived data types are nothing but primary data-types but a little twisted or grouped
together like array, structure, union and pointer. These are discussed in details later.


Q3. Define macro. Write a c program to demonstrate user defined macro.
Ans. A macro is a block of a code which will be replace by the value of the macro.
     It is a  pre=processor directive that allows you to define a symbolic name or identifies for a certain value or a block of code.
     Macros are processed by the pre-processor before actual compilation begins. 
    Example :
     #define PI 3.14
      PI =====> 3.14

   #include<stdio.h>
   #defien PI 3.14 //Define a macro for PI.
    
     int main()
     {
         float radius =5.0
         float area;
        
          area = PI * radius * radius;
          printf("Radius of the circle : %.2f \n", radius);
          printf("Area of the circle: %.2f \n ", area);

        return 0;
      }


Q4.Write a c program to demonstrate printf(),scanf(),fgets() and puts() with an example.
Ans.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() 
{
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float salary;
    char sentence[100];

    // Demonstrating printf() and scanf() for basic input and output
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    scanf("%s", name);  // Read a string input (ignores spaces)
    
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);  // Read an integer input
    
    printf("Enter your salary: ");
    scanf("%f", &salary);  // Read a float input

    // Displaying user information using printf()
    printf("\n--- User Information ---\n");
    printf("Name: %s\n", name);
    printf("Age: %d\n", age);
    printf("Salary: %.2f\n", salary);

    // Using fgets() and puts() to handle string input/output
    printf("\nEnter a sentence (up to 99 characters): ");
    getchar();  // Clear input buffer
    fgets(sentence, sizeof(sentence), stdin);  // Read a line of input including spaces

    // Displaying the sentence entered by the user using puts()
    printf("You entered: ");
    puts(sentence);  // Output the string

    return 0;
}


Q1. What is Makefile? Write a C program to demonstrate Makefile.
Ans. Makefile is a program building tool which is part of Unix and Linux OS used to automate the process of building software programs.
*Makefile is a set of commands(similar to terminal commands).
*It serves as a script that specifies how to compile and link program from its source and its dependencies.
*Makefile does not have Extension.
*In a single make file we can create multiple targets to compile and to remove object, binary files.
*You can compile your project(program) any number of times by using Makefile.

Example:-
main.c

#include<stdio.h>
#include"vivek.h" //user defined header file

int main()
{
        printf("Inside main function\n");
        printf("Calling hello function\n");
        hello();
        printf("Calling add function\n");
        add(3,5);
        printf("Back in main function\n");

        return 0;
}

hello.c

#include<stdio.h>
#include"vivek.h"

void hello()
{
        printf("Hi from Wipro\n");
}

add.c

#include<stdio.h>
#include"vivek.h"

void add(int a, int b) //a and b are argument
{
        printf("Sum = %d\n",a+b);
}

vivek.h

void hello();
void add(int a, int b);

1. gcc main.c hello.c add.c -o final
2../final

sudo apt install make
----------------------

Makefile:

final:
        gcc main.c add.c hello.c -o final



Q2. Write a C program to demonstrate relational, logical and bitwise operators
Ans. Relational Operators:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int a = 5, b = 3;

    // Relational operators
    printf("Relational Operators:\n");
    printf("%d > %d is %d\n", a, b, a > b);
    printf("%d < %d is %d\n", a, b, a < b);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d\n", a, b, a >= b);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d\n", a, b, a <= b);
    printf("%d == %d is %d\n", a, b, a == b);
    printf("%d != %d is %d\n", a, b, a != b);

    return 0;
}
 output:-5 > 3 is 1
5 < 3 is 0
5 >= 3 is 1
5 <= 3 is 0
5 == 3 is 0
5 != 3 is 1

*Logical Operators:-
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{

	int a=5, b=5, c=10, result;

	result=(a==b) && (c>b);

	printf("(a==b) && (c> b) is %d \n ", result);//1

	result=(a==b) && (c<b);
	printf("(a==b) && (c<b) is %d\n", result);//o

	result=(a==b) || (c<b);
	printf("(a==b) && (c<b) is %d\n", result);//1

	result =(a!=b) || (c<b);
	printf("(a!=b) is %d \n", result);//0
					  //
        result=!(a!=b);
	printf("!(a!=b) is %d\n", result); //--> 0 !0 is 1

	result =!(a==b);
	printf("!(a==b) is %d \n ", result);

	return 0;
}

Output:- (a==b) && (c>b) is 1
         (a==b) && (c<b) is 0
         (a==b) && (a<b) is 1
         (a!=b) is 0
         !(a!=b) is 1
         !(a==b) is 0

*Bitwise Operators:-
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int num1 = 13;   // 0000 1101 in binary
    unsigned int num2 = 7;    // 0000 0111 in binary
    unsigned int result;

    // Bitwise AND (&) operator
    result = num1 & num2;     // 0000 0101 = 5 in decimal
    printf("num1 & num2 = %u\n", result);

    // Bitwise OR (|) operator
    result = num1 | num2;     // 0000 1111 = 15 in decimal
    printf("num1 | num2 = %u\n", result);

    // Bitwise XOR (^) operator
    result = num1 ^ num2;     // 0000 1010 = 10 in decimal
    printf("num1 ^ num2 = %u\n", result);

    // Bitwise NOT (~) operator
    result = ~num1;           // 1111 0010 in binary (assuming 8-bit representation)
    printf("~num1 = %u\n", result);

    // Bitwise left shift (<<) operator
    result = num1 << 2;       // 0011 0100 = 52 in decimal
    printf("num1 << 2 = %u\n", result);

    // Bitwise right shift (>>) operator
    result = num1 >> 2;       // 0000 0011 = 3 in decimal
    printf("num1 >> 2 = %u\n", result);

    return 0;
}

Output:-num1 & num2 = 5
num1 | num2 = 15
num1 ^ num2 = 10
~num1 = 4294967282
num1 << 2 = 52
num1 >> 2 = 3




Q3. Explain storage classes with an example.
Ans. Storage classes define the scope, visibility and lifetime of the variables.
 *Four storage class are
 i. auto(automatic):- The 'auto' storage class is the default storage class for all local variables declred within a function or a block.
Their lifetime is limited to the block or function. 

ii. static:-static storage class is used to retain the values between the function calls.

iii.register:
register storage class:- register storage class is specifier that hint to thr compiler that a particular variable shoulr be stores in a processor register for quicker access.
-> CPU registers are small, fast storage locations within CPU that are used to store temporary data and perform operations.


iv. extern:-
extern storage class is used to declare a global variable or function in another file.
It extends the visibility of the variable or function to entire progrma.
This is especially useful in multi-file programs where you need to access variables or funtions across different files. 
 example:-external.c

 example:-external.c

#include<stdio.h>

int globalvariable=40;

void externalfunction()
{
        printf("This is an external function\n");
}

main.c

#include<stdio.h>

extern int globalvariable;

extern void externalfunction();

int main()
{
        printf("Value of the global variable : %d\n",globalvariable);

        externalfunction();

        return 0;
}


Q1. Write a c program to check whether character is uppercase or lowercase.
Ans:-
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char ch;

   
    printf("Enter a character: ");

    if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') 
    {
        printf("'%c' is uppercase.\n", ch);
    }
   else
     {
        printf("'%c' is lowercase.\n", ch);
     }
   

    return 0;
}
 
Output:-1.Enter a character: A
        A is Uppercase.
        2.Enter a character: c
        c is lowercase.

                               Example: When you declare a global variable or a static      variable within a function, memory is allocated statically.
   
 - Dynamic memory allocation: Memory is allocated at runtime.
                              Example: Using functions like malloc(), calloc()

2. Memory Size:
    - Static memory allocation: Memory size is fixed and determined at compile-time.
    - Dynamic memory allocation: Memory size can be determined at runtime and can change.

3. Memory Location:
    - Static memory allocation: Memory is allocated on the stack or in the data segment.
    - Dynamic memory allocation: Memory is allocated on the heap.

4. Memory Deallocation:
    - Static memory allocation: Memory is automatically deallocated when the program ends.
    - Dynamic memory allocation: Memory must be explicitly deallocated by the programmer using free() or delete.

5. Flexibility:
    - Static memory allocation: Less flexible, as memory size and location are fixed.
    - Dynamic memory allocation: More flexible, as memory size and location can be determined at runtime.


2.Write a C program to demonstrate malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free() using valgrind.
Ans.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() 
{
    int *ptr1, *ptr2, *ptr3;

    // Using malloc()
    ptr1 = (int*) malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    if (ptr1 == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return -1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        ptr1[i] = i * 2;
    }

    // Using calloc()
    ptr2 = (int*) calloc(5, sizeof(int));
    if (ptr2 == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return -1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        ptr2[i] = i * 3;
    }

    // Using realloc()
    ptr3 = (int*) realloc(ptr1, 10 * sizeof(int));
    if (ptr3 == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return -1;
        }
    for (int i = 5; i < 10; i++) {
        ptr3[i] = i * 4;
    }

    // Freeing memory
    free(ptr2);
    free(ptr3);

    return 0;
}
gcc -g file_name.c -o file_name
valgrind --leak-check=full ./file_name



3.What is pointer? Explain different types of pointers with programming example
Ans.A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It is a fundamental concept in programming, especially in languages like C.  Pointers allow for indirect memory access, dynamic memory allocation, and passing variables by reference.

Type of pointers are :-
1.Wild Pointers- 
⦁A wild pointer is a pointer that has not been initilaization to point to a specific memory location.
Such pointer can cantain arbitrary value ad if dereferenced can  lead to undefined behaviour.
⦁It may lead to prigram crash or corruptio of data.
⦁Example :- int *pte//Wild pointer

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr;  // Declaring a pointer without initializing it

    // Attempting to dereference a wild pointer
    *ptr = 10;  // Dereferencing ptr, which is uninitialized (wild pointer)

    printf("Value at wild pointer address: %d\n", *ptr);

    return 0;
}

 
2. NULL Pointer:
⦁A NULL pointer is a spacial type of pointer in C programming that is assigned a value of NULL.
⦁THis value indicates that the pointer is not pointing to any valid memory location.

Example:-
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr = NULL;  // Initialize pointer to NULL

    // Attempting to dereference a NULL pointer
    // *ptr = 10;  // Uncommenting this line will cause a runtime error (segmentation fault)

    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Pointer is NULL\n");
    } else {
        printf("Pointer is not NULL\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

3. void Pointer:-
⦁A void pointer is also known as generic pointer.
⦁It is declared using void type andd it can hold the address of any data type.
⦁The key feature of a void pointer is it is not associated with any particular data type.
⦁Using void pointer, we can print int value, float/double value, string and also we can print the address.

Example:-
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    float f = 3.14;
    char ch = 'A';

    void *ptr;  // Declare a void pointer

    // Pointing void pointer to different data types
    ptr = &num;
    printf("Value of num: %d\n", *(int *)ptr);

    ptr = &f;
    printf("Value of f: %.2f\n", *(float *)ptr);

    ptr = &ch;
    printf("Value of ch: %c\n", *(char *)ptr);

    return 0;
}
Output:-
Value of num: 10
Value of f: 3.14
Value of ch: A


4. Constant Pointer:-
⦁A Constant pointer is a pointer whose address value cannot be changes after initialization.
⦁Constant pointer must be initialized when it is declared.
⦁The data at the memeory location it points to can be modified, but the pointer itself cannot point to defferent location.

Example:-
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 20;

    // Constant pointer to integer
    int *const ptr = &num1;  // Pointer 'ptr' is constant

    printf("Value of num1: %d\n", *ptr);  // Accessing value using ptr

    // Attempting to change the value pointed by ptr
    *ptr = 15;  // Valid: modifying value at address pointed by ptr
    printf("Modified value of num1: %d\n", *ptr);

    // Attempting to change the address pointed by ptr
    // ptr = &num2;  // Invalid: Changing address ptr points to (const pointer)

    return 0;
}
Output-Value of num1: 10
Modified value of num1: 15

5.Pointer to constant:
⦁A pointer to a constant is a pointer that points to a constant value.
⦁This means, that the data pointed to by the pointer cannot be modified through the pointer, evan though pointer iteself can be made to point to another locarion.

Example:-
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 20;

    // Pointer to constant integer
    const int *ptr = &num1;

    printf("Value of num1: %d\n", *ptr);  // Accessing value using ptr

    // Attempting to change the value pointed by ptr
    // *ptr = 15;  // Invalid: Attempting to modify constant value through ptr

    // Pointing to a different constant integer
    ptr = &num2;
    printf("Value of num2: %d\n", *ptr);  // Accessing value using ptr

    return 0;
}
Output-Value of num1: 10
Value of num2: 20

6.Pointer to Pointer:-
Example
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    int *ptr1 = &num;  // Pointer to num
    int **ptr2 = &ptr1;  // Pointer to ptr1 (pointer to pointer)

    // Accessing and modifying value using pointer to pointer
    printf("Value of num: %d\n", **ptr2);  // Prints: Value of num: 10

    // Modifying value through pointer to pointer
    **ptr2 = 20;
    printf("Modified value of num: %d\n", **ptr2);  // Prints: Modified value of num: 20

    return 0;
}
Output-Value of num: 10
Modified value of num: 20


1. Explain OOP concepts with an example
Ans:-Class: Think of a blueprint or a recipe for building something. For example, a "Car Blueprint" defines what a car should have: wheels, engine, doors, etc.

Object: An object is an actual instance created based on the class blueprint. So, a specific car like a "Toyota Camry" is an object created from the "Car Blueprint".

*Encapsulatio:
Encapsulation is like a gift box that hides the inner workings of a present. It bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) together inside the class.
For instance, a car's engine is encapsulated — you don't need to know how the engine works to drive the car. You just use the accelerator (method) to make the car go faster.

*Inheritance:
Inheritance is akin to passing traits or properties from parents to children. In the real world, children inherit traits like eye color or hair type from their parents.
For example, a "Luxury Car" class can inherit features (attributes and methods) from a more general "Car" class, adding extra features like leather seats or advanced navigation.

=>In inheritance two Class are:
1. Base Class- It is also called a Parent class and Super class.
2. Derived Class-This is derived from Base class.

=>Types Of Inheritance
1.Single inheritance
2.Multiple inheritance
3.Hierarchical inheritance
4.Multilevel inheritance
5.Hybrid inheritance


*Polymorphism:
Polymorphism means "many forms". It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type.
Think of a "Vehicle" class with a method called drive(). A car, a bicycle, and a truck can all have their own unique drive() method, but you can call drive() on any vehicle and it behaves differently based on the specific type of vehicle.




2. Write any 5 differences between C and C++.
Ans.Here are five key differences between C and C++:
1.Programming Paradigm:
=>C: C is a procedural programming language, which means it focuses on functions or procedures that operate on data.
=>C++: C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. It extends C by adding classes and objects, allowing for better organization and reusability of code.

2.Standard Input/Output:
=>C: In C, input and output operations are performed using functions like printf and scanf.
=>C++: C++ uses stream-based input/output (iostream library), where input is read from cin and output is written to cout. It provides a more flexible and type-safe approach compared to C's printf and scanf.

3.Memory Management:
=>C: Memory management in C is done using functions like malloc, calloc, realloc, and free from the <stdlib.h> library.
=>C++: C++ supports these C functions but also introduces new and delete operators for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. Additionally, C++ provides smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, std::weak_ptr) for safer and automated memory management.

4.Function Overloading:
=>C: C does not support function overloading, meaning you cannot have multiple functions with the same name but different parameter types or numbers.
=>C++: C++ supports function overloading, allowing you to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. This promotes code readability and reusability.

5.Namespace Support:
=>C: C does not support namespaces. All global identifiers must have unique names across the entire program.
=>C++: C++ introduces namespaces (namespace keyword), which help organize code into logical groups and prevent name conflicts. Namespaces are particularly useful when integrating multiple libraries or modules into a single program.




3. Explain iostream, istream, ostream, cout, cin and endl
Ans.- iostream is the library that enables input/output operations.

- ostream is the output stream that carries data from your program to the outside world.

- cout is the tap that sends data to the screen.

- cin is the pipe that reads data from the keyboard.

- endl is the "enter" key that moves to a new line and forces the output to appear immediately.



4.Write a C++ program to check whether a given number is prime or not
Ans.
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
  int n, i, m=0, flag=0;  
  cout << "Enter the Number to check Prime: ";  
  cin >> n;  
  m=n/2;  
  for(i = 2; i <= m; i++)  
  {  
      if(n % i == 0)  
      {  
          cout<<"Number is not Prime."<<endl;  
          flag=1;  
          break;  
      }  
  }  
  if (flag==0)  
      cout << "Number is Prime."<<endl;  
  return 0;  
}  
Output:

Enter the Number to check Prime: 17  
 Number is Prime.   
Enter the Number to check Prime: 57  
Number is not Prime.
